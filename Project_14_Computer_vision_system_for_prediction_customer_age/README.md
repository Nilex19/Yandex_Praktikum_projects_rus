#  Computer vision system for prediction customer age

*Project status:*  
The project's complete.

*Description and purposes:*  
Computer vision system for processing customer photos, which will help determine the age of customers in order to:
- Analyze purchases and offer products that may interest buyers in particular age groups
- Monitor clerks selling alcohol

*Tools:*  
Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, PIL, Keras, Tensorflow

*Conclusions:*  
We have dataset with 7591 images with people ages from 1 to 100. Some photos colored, some black and white. Somewhere people are depicted the front face, somewhere the side view.  
We have best mae = 6.7397 with 20 epoches for ResNet50.
